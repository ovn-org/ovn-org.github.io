NAME
       ovn-detrace  -  convert  ``ovs-appctl ofproto/trace'' output to combine
       OVN logical flow information.

SYNOPSIS
       ovn-detrace < file

       Common options:
              [-h | --help] [-V | --version]


DESCRIPTION
       The ovn-detrace program reads ovs-appctl ofproto/trace output on stdin,
       looking for flow cookies, and expand each cookie with corresponding OVN
       logical flows. It expands logical flow  further  with  the  north-bound
       information  e.g.  the  ACL that generated the logical flow, when rele‐
       vant.

OPTIONS
       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

       --ovnsb=server
              The OVN Southbound DB remote to contact.  If the OVN_SB_DB envi‐
              ronment variable is set, its value is used as the default.  Oth‐
              erwise, the default  is  unix:@RUNDIR@/ovnsb_db.sock,  but  this
              default  is  unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN
              test environments.

       --ovnnb=server
              The OVN Northbound DB remote to contact.  If the OVN_NB_DB envi‐
              ronment variable is set, its value is used as the default.  Oth‐
              erwise, the default  is  unix:@RUNDIR@/ovnnb_db.sock,  but  this
              default  is  unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN
              test environments.

       --ovs= Also decode flow information (like OVS ofport) from the flows by
              connecting to the OVS DB.

       --ovsdb=server
              The  OVS  DB  remote  to  contact  if  --ovsis  present.  If the
              OVS_RUNDIR environment variable is set, its value is used as the
              default.  Otherwise,  the  default is unix:@RUNDIR@/db.sock, but
              this default is unlikely to be useful outside of  single-machine
              OVN test environments.
