ovn-nb \- OVN_Northbound database schema
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46] The CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database\[char46] The \fBovn\-northd\fR program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]
.PP
.PP
We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]
.SS "External IDs"
.PP
.PP
Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46] This column has the same form and purpose each place it appears\[char46]
.RS

\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by the CMS\[char46] The CMS might use certain pairs, for example, to identify entities in its own configuration that correspond to those in this database\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

It is recommended to use the same HA chassis group for all the external ports of a logical switch\[char46] Otherwise, the physical switch might see MAC flap issue when different chassis provide the native services\[char46] For example when supporting native DHCPv4 service, DHCPv4 server mac (configured in \fBoptions:server_mac\fR column in table \fBDHCP_Options\fR) originating from different ports can cause MAC flap issue\[char46] The MAC of the logical router IP(s) can also flap if the same HA chassis group is not set for all the external ports of a logical switch\[char46]

A name for the load balancer\[char46] This name has no special meaning or purpose other than to provide convenience for human interaction with the ovn-nb database\[char46]

A map of virtual IP addresses (and an optional port number with \fB:\fR as a separator) associated with this load balancer and their corresponding endpoint IP addresses (and optional port numbers with \fB:\fR as separators) separated by commas\[char46] If the destination IP address (and port number) of a packet leaving a container or a VM matches the virtual IP address (and port number) provided here as a key, then OVN will statefully replace the destination IP address by one of the provided IP address (and port number) in this map as a value\[char46] IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported for load balancing; however a VIP of one address family may not be mapped to a destination IP address of a different family\[char46] If specifying an IPv6 address with a port, the address portion must be enclosed in square brackets\[char46] Examples for keys are \(dq192\[char46]168\[char46]1\[char46]4\(dq and \(dq[fd0f::1]:8800\(dq\[char46] Examples for value are \(dq10\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]1, 10\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]2\(dq and \(dq20\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]10:8800, 20\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]11:8800\(dq\[char46]
.IP
When the \fBLoad_Balancer\fR is added to the \fBlogical_switch\fR, the VIP has to be in a different subnet than the one used for the \fBlogical_switch\fR\[char46] Since VIP is in a different subnet, you should connect your logical switch to either a OVN logical router or a real router (this is because the client can now send a packet with VIP as the destination IP address and router\(cqs mac address as the destination MAC address)\[char46]
.IP "\fBprotocol\fR: optional string, either \fBtcp\fR or \fBudp\fR"
Valid protocols are \fBtcp\fR or \fBudp\fR\[char46] This column is useful when a port number is provided as part of the \fBvips\fR column\[char46] If this column is empty and a port number is provided as part of \fBvips\fR column, OVN assumes the protocol to be \fBtcp\fR\[char46]

Gateways, as documented under \fBGateways\fR in the OVN architecture guide, provide limited connectivity between logical networks and physical ones\[char46] OVN support multiple kinds of gateways\[char46] The \fBLogical_Router_Port\fR table can be used three different ways to configure \fIdistributed gateway ports\fR, which are one kind of gateway\[char46] These different forms of configuration exist for historical reasons\[char46] All of them produce the same kind of OVN southbound records and the same behavior in practice\[char46]

If any of these are set, this logical router port represents a distributed gateway port that connects this router to a logical switch with a localnet port\[char46] There may be at most one such logical router port on each logical router\[char46]

The newest and most preferred way to configure a gateway is \fBha_chassis_group\fR, followed by \fBgateway_chassis\fR\[char46] Using \fBoptions:redirect-chassis\fR is deprecated\[char46] At most one of these should be set at a time on a given LRP, since they configure the same features\[char46]

Even when a gateway is configured, the logical router port still effectively resides on each chassis\[char46] However, due to the implications of the use of L2 learning in the physical network, as well as the need to support advanced features such as one-to-many NAT (aka IP masquerading), a subset of the logical router processing is handled in a centralized manner on the gateway chassis\[char46]

When more than one gateway chassis is specified, OVN only uses one at a time\[char46] OVN uses BFD to monitor gateway connectivity, preferring the highest-priority gateway that is online\[char46] Priorities are specified in the \fBpriority\fR column of \fBGateway_Chassis\fR or \fBHA_Chassis\fR\[char46]
