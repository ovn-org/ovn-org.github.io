	"content": "OVN, the Open Virtual Network, is a system to support logical network abstraction in virtual machine and container environments. OVN complements the existing capabilities of OVS to add native support for logical network abstractions, such as logical L2 and L3 overlays and security groups. Services such as DHCP are also desirable features. Just like OVS, OVN\u0026rsquo;s design goal is to have a production-quality implementation that can operate at significant scale.\nA physical network comprises physical wires, switches, and routers. A virtual network extends a physical network into a hypervisor or container platform, bridging VMs or containers into the physical network. An OVN logical network is a network implemented in software that is insulated from physical (and thus virtual) networks by tunnels or other encapsulations. This allows IP and other address spaces used in logical networks to overlap with those used on physical networks without causing conflicts. Logical network topologies can be arranged without regard for the topologies of the physical networks on which they run. Thus, VMs that are part of a logical network can migrate from one physical machine to another without network disruption.\nThe encapsulation layer prevents VMs and containers connected to a logical network from communicating with nodes on physical networks. For clustering VMs and containers, this can be acceptable or even desirable, but in many cases VMs and containers do need connectivity to physical networks. OVN provides multiple forms of gateways for this purpose.\nAn OVN deployment consists of several components:\nCloud Management System (CMS): integrates OVN into a physical network by managing the OVN logical network elements and connecting the OVN logical network infrastructure to physical network elements. Exmaples include OpenStack Neutron\u0026rsquo;s ml2/ovn plugin and the ovn-kubernetes project. OVN Databases: stores data representing the OVN logical and physical networks. Hypervisors: run Open vSwitch and translate the OVN logical network into OpenFlow on a physical or virtual machine. Gateways: extends a tunnel-based OVN logical network into a physical network by forwarding packets between tunnels and the physical network infrastructure.

	"content": "Latest OVN release Series The most recent series of OVN released is 23.09. Use this version if you are interested in trying out the latest release of OVN with the most up-to-date features and performance improvements.\nYou can find more information, including download links, release notes and changelogs for this series here.\nLong Term Support The OVN project will periodically designate a release as \u0026ldquo;long-term support\u0026rdquo; or LTS for short. An LTS release has the distinction of being maintained for longer than a standard release.\nLTS releases will receive bug fixes until the point that another LTS is released. At that point, the old LTS will receive an additional year of critical and security fixes. Critical fixes are those that are required to ensure basic operation (e.g. memory leak fixes, crash fixes). Security fixes are those that address concerns about exploitable flaws in OVN and that have a corresponding CVE report.\nLTS releases are scheduled to be released once every two years. This means that any given LTS will receive bug fix support for two years, followed by one year of critical bug fixes and security fixes.\nThe most recent LTS series of OVN released is 22.03. You can find more information, including download links, release notes and changelogs for this series here.\nStandard Term Support OVN release series that are not LTS are standard term support releases. Standard term support series are given full bug fix support for one year from the initial date of release. After this, they no longer receive any support.\nThe most recent standard term support series of OVN is 23.09. You can find more information, including download links, release notes and changelogs for this series here.\nOther Releases For all other releases, see the All Releases page.\n"

It can be enabled per logical switch with other_config \u0026#34;fdb_age_threshold\u0026#34;. - Add DHCPv6 \u0026#34;fqdn\u0026#34; (39) option, that works similarly to DHCPv4 \u0026#34;hostname\u0026#34; (12) option. - Support to create/update MAC_Binding when GARP received from VTEP (RAMP) switch on l3dgw port. - To allow optimizing ovn-controller\u0026#39;s monitor conditions for the regular VIF case, ovn-controller now unconditionally monitors all sub-ports (ports with parent_port set). - ECMP routes use L4_SYM dp-hash by default if the datapath supports it. Existing sessions might get re-hashed to a different ECMP path when OVN detects the algorithm support in the datapath during an upgrade or restart of ovn-controller. - Add \u0026#34;northd-backoff-interval-ms\u0026#34; config option to delay northd engine runs capped at the set value. - Add \u0026#34;garp-max-timeout-sec\u0026#34; config option to vswitchd external-ids to cap the time between when ovn-controller sends gARP packets. - Introduce support for binding remote ports in ovn-northd if the CMS sets requested-chassis option for a remote logical switch port. - Added support to reply success for DHCPv6 Release messages.

This addresses CVE-2023-3153. Changelog\nv23.06.0 v23.06.0 was released on 2 June, 2023.\nGithub link\nRelease Notes:\nOVN v23.06.0 - 01 Jun 2023 -------------------------- - Enhance LSP.options:arp_proxy to support IPv6, configurable MAC addresses and CIDRs. - CT entries are not flushed by default anymore whenever a load balancer backend is removed. A new, per-LB, option \u0026#39;ct_flush\u0026#39; can be used to restore the previous behavior. Disabled by default. - Add support to configure OVSDB inactivity probe interval for ovn-ic and ovn-controller-vtep. - Add LS.other_config:broadcast-arps-to-all-routers. If false then arp requests are only send to Logical Routers on that Logical Switch if the target mac address matches. Arp requests matching no Logical Router will only be forwarded to non-router ports. Default is true which keeps the existing behaviour of flooding these arp requests to all attached Ports. - Always allow IPv6 Router Discovery, Neighbor Discovery, and Multicast Listener Discovery protocols, regardless of ACLs defined. - Add IPv6 iPXE support introducing \u0026#34;bootfile_name\u0026#34; (59) and \u0026#34;bootfile_name_alt\u0026#34; (254) options to ovn dhcpv6 server. - Support using local OVS port as port-mirroring target, and also support \u0026#39;both\u0026#39; directions for the \u0026#39;filter\u0026#39; field. - Increased ovn-{ic-,}{n,s}bctl default OVSDB inactivity probe interval from 5000 ms to 120000 ms to give the ability to connect to large databases (mainly, OVN_Southbound). Also, for daemon mode it is possible to configure inactivity probe interval via OVN_Northbound and OVN_Southbound databases for ovn-nbctl and ovn-sbctl respectively. See man ovn-nb and man ovn-sb for \u0026#39;nbctl_probe_interval\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;sbctl_probe_interval\u0026#39; options for more details. - Rework OVN egress QoS implementation in order to rely on OvS interface instead of directly running tc from OVN. Get rid of traffic shaping on the tunnel interfaces. Now for LSPs running on a LogicalSwitch with a localnet port is possible to define QoS rules to apply to the local egress localnet port. Please note now the QoS will be applied just to the local localnet port and not to all localnet port marked with ovn-egress iface. - Support for tiered ACLs has been added. This allows for ACLs to be layered into separate tiers of priority. For more information, please see the ovn-nb and ovn-northd manpages. - Send ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets back to offending ports when communicating with multichassis ports using frames that don\u0026#39;t fit through a tunnel. This is done only for logical switches that are attached to a physical network via a localnet port, in which case multichassis ports may have an effective MTU different from regular ports and hence may need this mechanism to maintain connectivity with other peers in the network.

In order to enable the feature the CMS has to set install_ls_lb_from_router to true in option column of NB_Global table. - Added nb_global IPsec options ipsec_encapsulation=true (libreswan) and ipsec_forceencaps=true (strongswan) to unconditionally enforce NAT-T UDP encapsulation. Requires OVS support for IPsec custom tunnel options (which is available in OVS 3.0). - Removed possibility of disabling logical datapath groups. - Removed the copying of SB\u0026#39;s Chassis other_config into external_ids. - Added MAC binding aging mechanism, that is disabled by default. It can be enabled per logical router with option \u0026#34;mac_binding_age_threshold\u0026#34;. - If it is needed to create Load Balancer within LR with VIP, which matches any of LR\u0026#39;s LRP IP, there is no need to create SNAT entry.
