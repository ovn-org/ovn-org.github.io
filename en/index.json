	"content": "OVN, the Open Virtual Network, is a system to support logical network abstraction in virtual machine and container environments. OVN complements the existing capabilities of OVS to add native support for logical network abstractions, such as logical L2 and L3 overlays and security groups. Services such as DHCP are also desirable features. Just like OVS, OVN\u0026rsquo;s design goal is to have a production-quality implementation that can operate at significant scale.\nA physical network comprises physical wires, switches, and routers. A virtual network extends a physical network into a hypervisor or container platform, bridging VMs or containers into the physical network. An OVN logical network is a network implemented in software that is insulated from physical (and thus virtual) networks by tunnels or other encapsulations. This allows IP and other address spaces used in logical networks to overlap with those used on physical networks without causing conflicts. Logical network topologies can be arranged without regard for the topologies of the physical networks on which they run. Thus, VMs that are part of a logical network can migrate from one physical machine to another without network disruption.\nThe encapsulation layer prevents VMs and containers connected to a logical network from communicating with nodes on physical networks. For clustering VMs and containers, this can be acceptable or even desirable, but in many cases VMs and containers do need connectivity to physical networks. OVN provides multiple forms of gateways for this purpose.\nAn OVN deployment consists of several components:\nCloud Management System (CMS): integrates OVN into a physical network by managing the OVN logical network elements and connecting the OVN logical network infrastructure to physical network elements. Exmaples include OpenStack Neutron\u0026rsquo;s ml2/ovn plugin and the ovn-kubernetes project. OVN Databases: stores data representing the OVN logical and physical networks. Hypervisors: run Open vSwitch and translate the OVN logical network into OpenFlow on a physical or virtual machine. Gateways: extends a tunnel-based OVN logical network into a physical network by forwarding packets between tunnels and the physical network infrastructure.

	"content": "Latest OVN release Series The most recent series of OVN released is 25.09. Use this version if you are interested in trying out the latest release of OVN with the most up-to-date features and performance improvements.\nYou can find more information, including download links, release notes and changelogs for this series here.\nLong Term Support The OVN project will periodically designate a release as \u0026ldquo;long-term support\u0026rdquo; or LTS for short. An LTS release has the distinction of being maintained for longer than a standard release.\nLTS releases will receive bug fixes until the point that another LTS is released. At that point, the old LTS will receive an additional year of critical and security fixes. Critical fixes are those that are required to ensure basic operation (e.g. memory leak fixes, crash fixes). Security fixes are those that address concerns about exploitable flaws in OVN and that have a corresponding CVE report.\nLTS releases are scheduled to be released once every two years. This means that any given LTS will receive bug fix support for two years, followed by one year of critical bug fixes and security fixes.\nThe most recent LTS series of OVN released is 24.03. You can find more information, including download links, release notes and changelogs for this series here.\nStandard Term Support OVN release series that are not LTS are standard term support releases. Standard term support series are given full bug fix support for one year from the initial date of release. After this, they no longer receive any support.\nThe most recent standard term support series of OVN is 25.09. You can find more information, including download links, release notes and changelogs for this series here.\nOther Releases For all other releases, see the All Releases page.\n"

Support for this version will end on 5 September, 2026.\nv25.09.0 v25.09.0 was released on 5 September, 2025.\nGithub link\nRelease Notes:\nOVN v25.09.0 - 05 Sep 2025 -------------------------- - STT tunnels are no longer supported in ovn-encap-type. ** WARNING ** Existing setups must be fully reconfigured to use Geneve or VxLAN before upgrading. To avoid potential database conversion issues all OVN databases should be manually compacted after the reconfiguration. For instructions see: https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/ref/ovsdb.7/#compacting-databases - Added support for \u0026#34;ovn-cleanup-on-exit\u0026#34; config option in Open_vSwitch external-ids, this option allows to specify if ovn-controller should perform cleanup when exiting. The \u0026#34;--restart\u0026#34; exit always has priority to keep the backward compatibility. - Add additional protocol support for options:activation-strategy. The new supported protocols are gARP and NA. The option now supports a comma separated to specify selected group of protocols. - Add CoPP support for DHCP relay. - SSL/TLS: * Support for deprecated TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols on OpenFlow and database connections is now removed. - Introduce exclude-router-ips-from-garp in logical_switch_port column so that the router port IPs are not advertised in the GARPs. - Added support for port mirroring in OVN overlay. - Added \u0026#34;ic-route-filter-adv\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;ic-route-filter-learn\u0026#34; options to the Logical_Router/Logical_Router_Port tables to allow users to filter advertised/learned IC routes. - Add a new logical switch option - enable-stateless-acl-lb with default value of false. This option should be set to true for logical switches with stateless ACL to work with load balancer. - Added new ovn-nbctl command \u0026#39;pg-get-ports\u0026#39; to get the ports assigned to the port group. - The ovn-controller option ovn-ofctrl-wait-before-clear is no longer supported. It will be ignored if used. ovn-controller will automatically care about proper delay before clearing lflow. - Added \u0026#34;ic-route-adv-lb\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;ic-route-learn-lb\u0026#34; NB_Global:options to to allow advertising load balancer VIPs through OVN-IC. - Added a new ACL option \u0026#34;--all\u0026#34; to \u0026#34;acl-list\u0026#34; command. When set, \u0026#34;acl-list\u0026#34; command will also list port groups ACLs associated with each port of the target logical switch. - Added support for running tests from the \u0026#39;check-kernel\u0026#39; system test target under retis by setting OVS_TEST_WITH_RETIS=yes. See the \u0026#39;Testing\u0026#39; section of the documentation for more details. - Dynamic Routing: * Add the option \u0026#34;dynamic-routing-redistribute-local-only\u0026#34; to Logical Routers and Logical Router Ports which refines the way in which chassis-specific Advertised_Routes (e.g., for NAT and LB IPs) are advertised. * Add the option \u0026#34;external-ids:ovn-evpn-vxlan-ports\u0026#34; for the Open_vSwitch database. This option allows CMS to set list of UDP destination ports that will be used to create the VXLAN tunnels. * Add the option \u0026#34;external-ids:ovn-evpn-local-ip\u0026#34; for the Open_vSwitch database. This option allows CMS to set IP address that will be used as source for the EVPN traffic egressing through the tunnel. * Add the \u0026#34;other_config:dynamic-routing-vni\u0026#34; to Logical Switches. If set to valid integer the LS is considered to be connected to EVPN L2 domain. * Add the \u0026#34;other_config:dynamic-routing-fdb-prefer-local\u0026#34; to Logical Switches. If set to \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; the LS will prefer SB FDB table for FDB lookup. Default is false. * Add the \u0026#34;other_config:dynamic-routing-redistribute\u0026#34; to Logical Switches. The only accepted value at the moment is \u0026#34;fdb\u0026#34;. - ovn-sbctl: * Added --filter option that allows filtering the command output. See ovn-sbctl(8) for more details. Changelog\n"

Support for this version will end on 7 March, 2026.\nv25.03.1 v25.03.1 was released on 13 June, 2025.\nGithub link\nRelease Notes:\nOVN v25.03.1 - 13 Jun 2025 -------------------------- - Bug fixes Changelog\nv25.03.0 v25.03.0 was released on 7 March, 2025.\nGithub link\nRelease Notes:\nOVN v25.03.0 - 07 Mar 2025 -------------------------- - Added support to choose selection methods - dp_hash or hash (with specified hash fields) for ECMP routes while choosing nexthop. - ovn-ic: Add support for route tag to prevent route learning. - Support for STT tunnels in ovn-encap-type is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. - The LRP option \u0026#39;centralize_routing\u0026#39; has been removed. The behavior is now enabled in all cases where it is needed. - ovn-nb: Changed schema of ovn-nb to make networks optional within Logical Router Ports. - Added support for Spine-Leaf topology of logical switches by adding a new LSP type \u0026#39;switch\u0026#39; that can directly connect two logical switches. Supported for both distributed and transit switches. - Bump python version required for building OVN to 3.7. - SSL/TLS: * TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 protocols are deprecated and disabled by default on OpenFlow and database connections. Use --ssl-protocols to turn them back on. Support will be fully removed in the next release. * OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer is now required for SSL/TLS support. * The protocol list in --ssl-protocols or corresponding database column now supports specifying simple protocol ranges like: - \u0026#34;TLSv1-TLSv1.2\u0026#34; to enable all protocols between TLSv1 and TLSv1.2. - \u0026#34;TLSv1.2+\u0026#34; to enable protocol TLSv1.2 and later. The value must be a list of protocols or exactly one protocol range. * Added explicit support for TLSv1.3. It can now be enabled via --ssl-protocols (TLSv1.3 was supported in earlier versions only when this option was not set). TLS ciphersuites for TLSv1.3 and later can be configured via --ssl-ciphersuites (--ssl-ciphers only applies to TLSv1.2 and earlier). - Add \u0026#34;arp-nd-max-timeout-sec\u0026#34; config option to vswitchd external-ids to configure the interval (in seconds) between ovn-controller originated ARP/ND packets used for tracking ECMP next hop MAC addresses. - Auto flush ECMP symmetric reply connection states when an ECMP route is removed by the CMS. This behavior is controlled by the \u0026#34;ecmp_nexthop_monitor_enable\u0026#34; config option in the NB_Global table. Disabled by default. - Improved handling of IPv6 traffic by enabling address prefix tracking in OVS for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, whenever possible, reducing the amount of IPv6 datapath flows. - Add concept of Transit Routers, users are now allowed to specify options:requested-chassis for router ports; if the chassis is remote then the router port will behave as a remote port. - Added a new ACL option \u0026#34;persist-established\u0026#34; that allows for established connections to bypass ACL matching. This way, if an ACL match changes, traffic on the established connection can still pass. - Logical router policies can now be arranged in chains. Using the new \u0026#34;jump\u0026#34; action, combined with new \u0026#34;chain\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;jump_chain\u0026#34; columns, allows for policies to be chained together. - Reduce the max number of local datapath to 1024 when OVN is using VXLAN encapsulation type in OVN-interconnect mode. - Added vxlan_mode parameter in IC_NB_GLOBAL option column to enable or disable VXLAN encapsulation type in OVN-interconnect mode. - Dynamic Routing: * Add the option \u0026#34;dynamic-routing\u0026#34; to Logical Routers. If set to true static and connected routes matching the filter below are shared to the southbound \u0026#34;Advertised_Route\u0026#34; table for sharing outside of OVN. The routes can further be configured by setting `dynamic-routing-redistribute` on the LR or LRP. The LRP settings overwrite the LR settings for all routes using this interface to forward traffic on. * Allow Logical Routers to dynamically learn routes from outside the fabric. Routes entered into the \u0026#34;Learned_Route\u0026#34; table in the southbound database will be learned by the respective LR. They are included in the route table with a lower priority than static routes. * Add the option value \u0026#34;connected-as-host\u0026#34; to the \u0026#34;dynamic-routing-redistribute\u0026#34; LR and LRP option. If set then connected routes are announced as individual host routes. * Add the option \u0026#34;dynamic-routing-maintain-vrf\u0026#34; to LRPs. If set the ovn-controller will create a vrf named \u0026#34;ovnvrf\u0026#34; + datapath id that includes all advertised and learned routes. The vrf name can be overwritten with the \u0026#34;dynamic-routing-vrf-name\u0026#34; setting. * Add the option \u0026#34;dynamic-routing-port-name\u0026#34; to LRPs. If set only routes learned from a linux interfaces that is locally bound to the referenced LSP will be learned. Additionally support local overwrites for arbitrary interface names using \u0026#34;dynamic-routing-port-mapping\u0026#34;. * The logical router port options \u0026#34;routing-protocol-redirect\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;routing-protocols\u0026#34; are now also usable on distributed gateway ports. * Logical router port options \u0026#34;routing-protocol-redirect\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;routing-protocols\u0026#34; are now considered stable. Their \u0026#34;experimental\u0026#34; tag was removed. - Add \u0026#34;options:ct-commit-all\u0026#34; to LR, that enables commit of all traffic to DNAT and SNAT zone when LR is stateful.

The previous name is still recognized to aid with backwards compatibility. - NATs can now be given an arbitrary match condition and priority. This allows for conditional NATs to be configured. See the ovn-nb(5) man page for more information. - Added new global config option NB_Global:options:vxlan_mode to support ability to disable \u0026#34;VXLAN mode\u0026#34; to extend available tunnel IDs space for datapaths from 4095 to 16711680. For more details see man ovn-nb(5) for mentioned option. - Added new global config option NB_Global:options:always_tunnel. If set to true, the traffic destined to a logical port of a provider logical switch (having a localnet port) will be tunnelled instead of sending it via the localnet port. - Added support to define boundaries (min and max values) for selected ct zones. - Add support for CT zone limit that can be specified per LR (options:ct-zone-limit), LS (other_config:ct-zone-limit) or LSP (options:ct-zone-limit). - A new LSP option \u0026#34;disable_garp_rarp\u0026#34; has been added to prevent OVN from sending GARP or RARP announcements when a VIF is created on a bridged logical switch. - A new LRP option \u0026#39;centralize_routing\u0026#39; has been added to a distributed gateway port to centralize routing if the logical switch of its peer doesn\u0026#39;t have a localnet port. - The NB_Global.debug_drop_domain_id configured value is now overridden by the ID associated with the Sampling_App record created for drop sampling (Sampling_App.type configured as \u0026#34;drop\u0026#34;). - Add support for ACL sampling through the new Sample_Collector and Sample tables. Sampling is supported for both traffic that creates new connections and for traffic that is part of an existing connection. - Add \u0026#34;external_ids:ovn-encap-ip-default\u0026#34; config for ovn-controller to determine the default encap IP when there are multiple encap IPs configured. - Added a new column in the southbound database \u0026#34;flow_desc\u0026#34; to provide human readable context to flows. - Added two new experimental logical router port options, \u0026#34;routing-protocol-redirect\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;routing-protocols\u0026#34;, that allow redirection of routing protocol traffic received by a router port to a different logical switch port.

	"content": "OVN Open Virtual Network OVN (Open Virtual Network) is a series of daemons for the Open vSwitch that translate virtual network configurations into OpenFlow. OVN is licensed under the open source Apache 2 license.\nOVN provides a higher-layer of abstraction than Open vSwitch, working with logical routers and logical switches, rather than flows. OVN is intended to be used by cloud management software (CMS). For details about the architecture of OVN, see the ovn-architecture manpage. Some high-level features offered by OVN include:\nDistributed virtual routers Distributed logical switches Access Control Lists DHCP DNS server Like Open vSwitch, OVN is written in platform-independent C. OVN runs entirely in userspace and therefore requires no kernel modules to be installed.\nLatest Release Download the latest release of OVN on the releases page on the left. For a summary of changes in the latest release, see here.\nDistribution documentation (aka man pages) is available here.\nIRC meetings We have weekly IRC meetings you can participate in:\nOVN weekly IRC meeting every Thu 09:15 AM US Pacific (e.g., Los Angeles, California time) in #openvswitch on irc.libera.chat.\nOVN code used to live within the Open vSwitch codebase. It was split into its own repo in 2019.\n"
