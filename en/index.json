	"content": "OVN Open Virtual Network OVN (Open Virtual Network) is a series of daemons that translates virtual network configuration into OpenFlow, and installs them into Open vSwitch. It is licensed under the open source Apache 2 license.\nOVN is provides a higher-layer abstraction then Open vSwitch, working with logical routers and logical switches, rather than flows. OVN is intended to be used by cloud management software (CMS). For details about the architecture of OVN, see the ovn-architecture manpage. Some high-level features offered by OVN include\n Distributed virtual routers Distributed logical switches Access Control Lists DHCP DNS server  Like Open vSwitch, OVN is written in platform-independent C. OVN runs entirely in userspace and therefore requires no kernel modules to be installed.\nIRC meetings We have weekly IRC meetings you can participate in:\nOVN weekly IRC meeting every Thu 1715 UTC\nFreenode #openvswitch\nUntil recently, OVN code lived within the Open vSwitch codebase. OVN has recently been split into its own repo.\n "
